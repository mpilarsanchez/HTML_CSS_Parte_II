    Luke? Luke? Luke? Have you seen Luke this <span>morning</span>? He
    said he had some things to do before he started today,
    so he left early. Uh? Did he take those two new droids
    with him? I think so. Well, he'd better have those units
    in the south range <a href="">repaired</a> be midday or there'll be
    hell to pay! Wait, there's something dead ahead on the
    scanner. It looks like our droid...hit the accelerator.
